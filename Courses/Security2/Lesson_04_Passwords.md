Lesson Content:

Make passwords as long as you can possible make them. Unfortunately some websites don't allow you to make them too long, so you'll just need to play by their rules. They should be as random as you can make it. Have a computer generate the password for you. A different password for every single login you have, and never ever share them without anyone. No one here is ever going to ask for your password, and if they do you can safely ignore the request.

Use a password manager. If you're not sure which one to use, [1Password]() is what we use here. So you may as well use that. [LastPass]() is another popular one.

Never answer security questions honestly, and always treat them like passwords. It is not a police interrogation, you are under no obligation to answer security questions truthfully under any circumstance.

The next topic we're going to talk about is passwords. I talked about passwords in immense detail in [the last training](), so we're not going to spend too much time on this.

Last time I showed you how attackers will crack passwords and why you should pick good passwords because of that. Hopefully you all found that fun and convincing.

### Password Best Practices

_042. Best practices for passwords._

The main points of that were that your passwords need to be,

* Long
* Random
* Unique
* Private

So make them as long as you can possible make them. Unfortunately some websites don't allow you to make them too long, so you'll just need to play by their rules. They should be as random as you can make it. Have a computer generate the password for you. A different password for every single login you have, and never ever share them without anyone. No one here is ever going to ask for your password, and if they do you can safely ignore the request.

### Password Manager

_043. Use a password manager. [Reference]()_

The key takeaway was to use a password manager. Hopefully me showing you how to crack passwords very easily last time was a good convincer of that.

If you're not sure which one to use, [1Password]() is what we use here. So you may as well use that. [LastPass]() is another popular one.

[KeePass]() is one that some folks use too, but a word of caution there is that `keepass.com` is **NOT** the legitimate website. The real website is [`keepass.info`](). The `.com` one actually has download links that contain malware, and unfortunately the website looks more legit than the real one.

I would stick with 1Password or LastPass if I were you, but don't get tricked by the bad KeePass website.

### Security Questions

_044. Security questions aren't good for security._

I also showed how security question answers are basically the same as a password. Never answer them honestly, and always treat them like passwords. It is not a police interrogation, you are under no obligation to answer security questions truthfully under any circumstance.

It's the same with personal information. A shopping website doesn't need to know your date of birth, give them a fake one and store it in your password manager's "Notes" section.

### Support PIN

_045. Be aware of backdoors to your account._

These are often used as backdoors into your account. Support PIN is another one that I've seen various websites use. A four digit PIN that will get you back into your account. It doesn't matter how good your password is, 10,000 attempts and anyone can get into your account. There's not a lot you can do in these situations, you've just got to play their game. Just be aware of what's happening and try not to store any sensitive information with any website that does it.

Unfortunately, in my experience, banks and finance related websites tend to be the worst when it comes to these things. You just need to play their game and hope that they'll give you your money back if someone breaks into your account. Small comfort, I know.
