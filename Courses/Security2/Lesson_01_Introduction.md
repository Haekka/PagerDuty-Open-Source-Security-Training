_001. "Security Training for Everyone Part II: Attack of the Clones"._

Welcome to "Security Training for Everyone"! Not only the most enjoyable training we offer, but also the most mandatory. As most of you are aware, all company employees, contractors, and interns are required to undergo annual security training in order to understand the threats we face and how to protect us from them. Doing the same training each year would quickly get tedious (as those of you who went through our old training a few times will attest to), so you'll be pleased to know that this is not a repeat of of our previous security training. While we will be going over some of the same topics in order to refresh your knowledge, and some of the takeaways will be the same, the content is all new. Topics that we paid a lot of attention to last year will only be skimmed over this time around, and we're going to dig a bit deeper on the topics we only briefly touched on last time.

So this is part two of "Security Training for Everyone", which I'm calling "Part II: Attack of the Clones".

I came up with that title entirely on my own. It's definitely [not stolen from something else](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0121765/).

### Never Shame

_006. We will never shame you._

Never ever be afraid to come to us if you've done something silly. If you've clicked a link in an email that you shouldn't have. If you've been scammed out of some money. If you've put the company at risk in any way, we want to know about it. We will not shame you, we will not name you in any post-mortem, we will not call you an idiot. You're already going to be feeling pretty bad if you've been scammed, and we're not going to add on top of that.

We may mention that the incident happened, that "an employee did x", but we're never going to badmouth anyone. We're also not going to let your boss know, and you're not going to get fired or anything like that. Unless you actually stole something or committed a crime of course. So y'know... please don't do that.

But you should never be afraid to bring anything to us.

### Here to Help

<input type="checkbox" id="007" /><label for="007">![007](/slides/for_everyone_part_ii/for_everyone_part_ii.007.jpeg)</label>
_007. We're here to help._

Our job is that we're here to **help you**. 

We're not here to punish you for clicking a wrong link, and we're not here to say "No" to everything. That said, we do have to say "No" to some things though, I'm sorry, that's just the way it is. But even if we're forced to say "No", we'll work with you to reach a solution that is acceptable for both of us. We're not just going to tell you to go away and leave us alone or anything like that.

We're not just here for work related things either. If you have questions about security and your personal internet usage, such as how to secure your Facebook account, or you got an email saying an account of yours was hacked, etc. We're happy to help with that stuff too. Obviously we'll need to prioritize work related things, but you can always feel free to come to us with any type of security questions you may have.

### Goal

_008. Goal of the training._

The goal of this training hasn't changed from previous years. You're all here to gain insights into the threats we face and to help learn to protect us from those threats. So I'm going to be discussing today various different threats we face as a company, some more important than others, and how to go about protecting yourself from them, and what you can do to help to protect the company from them.
