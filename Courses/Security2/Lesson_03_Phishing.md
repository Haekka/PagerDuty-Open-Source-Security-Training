### Half of Phishing Emails

<input type="checkbox" id="022" /><label for="022">![022](/slides/for_everyone_part_ii/for_everyone_part_ii.022.jpeg)</label>
_022. Over half of phishing emails claim to be from the CEO._

Over half of our phishing emails claim to be from the CEO.

That's a pretty big thing if 50% of our phishing emails are claiming to be from the CEO. Hopefully what you take away from this is that if you think you've got an email from the CEO, you probably didn't. It's not just the CEO either, the rest of the phishing emails usually end up being someone from our exec team or legal counsel.

So if you get an email from any of our execs that you're not expecting, it's highly likely to be a phishing attack.

### Phishing is Easy

_023. Phishing is one of the easiest attacks._

Phishing is still the easiest attack someone can launch against us. They don't need any prerequisite knowledge. They just need a burner email account and some contact information which they can no doubt grab from LinkedIn and they're good to go.

### Easy to Spot

<input type="checkbox" id="024" /><label for="024">![024](/slides/for_everyone_part_ii/for_everyone_part_ii.024.jpeg)</label>
_024. Some will be easy to spot... [Reference](https://www.reddit.com/r/therewasanattempt/comments/bix795/to_scam_19_people/)_

They used to be pretty easy to spot, like when someone tries to scam 18 people at once. We've literally had phishing emails where a bunch of our staff were in CC. These are always easy to spot. But we have to be careful now that we're a public company, as we have a larger target on our backs.

People are going to be doing more research before launching these attacks, they'll be able to get better information from our public filings, and be able to launch much more targeted and legitimate seeming attacks against us.

### Phishing Email

_025. A phishing email we received._

So we're going to look at a much more targeted email now. This was an email sent to an employee in our London office and I love it because it has an example of pretty much every red flag and technique that phishing scammers love to use. It's almost as if they knew I was doing this training soon and wanted to give me a great single example of everything.

### Wrong Email

<input type="checkbox" id="026" /><label for="026">![026](/slides/for_everyone_part_ii/for_everyone_part_ii.026.jpeg)</label>
_026. Wrong email address._

Hopefully you've immediately spotted that this is a phishing attack before even reading the content, as the from address is completely wrong.

Unfortunately Gmail no longer puts the address in the top bar anymore, it's hidden away "for your convenience", so you have to click some extra arrows to see it. They will sometimes put up a big yellow banner if the name matches someone in our organization, but that doesn't always appear so you can't rely on it. So for now you'll always need to click the arrow to see the real email address.

But do check the from address if you're suspicious of emails. It is a 100% indicator that it's a scam email if the address is incorrect. If the address looks correct though, it doesn't mean that it is, it could have been spoofed. But if the address is wrong, it's definitely phishing.

---

### Always Check From Address

_027. Always check the "from" address._

So that makes this our first Pagey's Key Takeaway! Always check the "from" address in emails. If it's wrong, it's definitely phishing. If it's correct, it _might_ be phishing.

### Limiting Interactions

<input type="checkbox" id="028" /><label for="028">![028](/slides/for_everyone_part_ii/for_everyone_part_ii.028.jpeg)</label>
_028. Limiting interactions with other teams._

What else is suspicious in this email? They have this great line,

> "No one else except us must be informed at this time."

What they're trying to do here is to scare you into not contacting the security or legal teams internally in order to check the validity of the message. They're trying to say it's a legal matter to scare you into not talking to anyone about it, since everyone is afraid of lawyers. This is a very common tactic by scammers to try and limit who you can communicate with to verify the authenticity of something. It's trying to isolate you so you can only make the decision for yourself.

You can always check any email that has been sent to your PagerDuty account with our legal team at the very least. Always. You can also share it with the security team, but if you're hesitant to do that since maybe it's financial information, then share it with our legal team first. **There is absolutely no situation where anything that comes to your company email account cannot be shared with company counsel.** So don't fall for that trick.

### Forcing Language

<input type="checkbox" id="029" /><label for="029">![029](/slides/for_everyone_part_ii/for_everyone_part_ii.029.jpeg)</label>
_029. Forcing and limiting language being used._

Another common tactic is a forced sense of urgency.

> "This is a high priority situation"

<!-- -->

> "We're losing $100,000s a minute"

Those kinds of things. They love to try and get you to make quick actions without having chance to think it through.

Another one is forcing you into specific communication channels. This might present itself as these types of phrases,

> "I'm in meetings all day and can only communicate via email"

<!-- -->

> "I can't speak on my phone right now"

And so on. An attacker may have compromised one of the methods of communication and wants to make sure you don't try to validate it any other way. They know if you spoke on the phone with them that you'd know it's not real, so they're forcing you into text communication only.

So be very wary of any language which forces a sense of urgency on you, or tries to limit the communication channels you can use to verify the authenticity.

### Beware of Language

<input type="checkbox" id="030" /><label for="030">![030](/slides/for_everyone_part_ii/for_everyone_part_ii.030.jpeg)</label>
_030. Beware of forcing or limiting language._

That's our next Pagey Key Takeaway. Forcing or limiting language will weed out about 20% of the phishing emails we get. So after checking the from address, this type of language becomes the next strongest indicator for us.

---

### Validating Compliance

<input type="checkbox" id="031" /><label for="031">![031](/slides/for_everyone_part_ii/for_everyone_part_ii.031.jpeg)</label>
_031. Validating your willingness to comply._

Another common tactic, but not quite as common, and not always a solid indicator but something I wanted to point out anyway. An attacker will often send an initial email that isn't asking for anything sensitive. They might just say something like,

> "Hey, can you send me your phone number? I need to talk to you quickly about something important"

On the surface that's not really sensitive information, you're not being asked to transfer any money, and it sounds like they want to actually speak to you on the phone, so you might comply with that action.

Then they'll text you to say,

> "Actually, I can't speak right now, let's just do this over text, can you go and do X for me?"

At the back of your mind it's very easy for that to trick you into thinking that you've already verified who they are on two separate channels, email and voice, even though you never really did verify it both times.

The first message they send is validating your willingness to comply. They're validating that you're someone who follows instructions without really looking at things too deeply. If you do comply, they're more likely to hit you with a more important or sensitive question later once they've built up a rapport with you. It might be the next email, it might be five emails later, then they'll drop the big bomb on you and ask you to send them money and so on.

All that time they've been building up a rapport with you and in the back of your mind it's easy to convince yourself that you're speaking to a legitimate person. So that's something to keep and eye out for, but it's not a 100% indicator.

---

### Real Information

<input type="checkbox" id="032" /><label for="032">![032](/slides/for_everyone_part_ii/for_everyone_part_ii.032.jpeg)</label>
_032. Real information can also be used._

Then there's factual information. The attacker here did their homework. The law firm they mention is indeed a real law firm that we use. So they added that to the email to sound more legitimate. So as you're reading the email, you might think "Oh, they know this piece of information so they must be who they say they are". Don't get fooled.

It works both ways too though, they screwed it up a little bit by mentioning the Financial Markets Authority, which is a New Zealand entity, not something in the UK (where it's the FSA, Financial Services Authority). They were emailing one of our London employees at the time, so they tipped their hand with some bad information.

They can get factual information correct which may sound convincing, they can get factual information wrong, which is a good way to show that they're a scammer. So don't just assume if they drop some facts you think only they could know that they're a legitimate person, they might not be.

### Spelling and Grammar

<input type="checkbox" id="033" /><label for="033">![033](/slides/for_everyone_part_ii/for_everyone_part_ii.033.jpeg)</label>
_033. Speeling and grammar._

And finally, grammar and spelling mistakes. I would expect one or two mistakes in an email if someone is particularly rushed, but this one is just incredibly sloppy and not something that Jennifer would write. No one on our exec team is this bad at writing emails... to my knowledge anyway.

So if there's plenty of grammar or spelling mistakes, take that as a sign to look at the email more closely.

---

### Suspicious Emails

<input type="checkbox" id="034" /><label for="034">![034](/slides/for_everyone_part_ii/for_everyone_part_ii.034.jpeg)</label>
_034. Report suspicious emails to us._

Bottom line with all of this is that if you're suspicious of emails, please send them to the Security Team and we'll be able to validate if it's legitimate or not.

Even if you're 100% confident it is a phishing email, don't just delete it, please do send it to us. Even though you've spotted it, others in the company may have received it and not spotted it. If you let us know straight away we have a chance to delete it from everyone's inbox before anyone even has a chance to click any links inside it.

We'd rather get 300 duplicate reports than no report at all. So don't be afraid to bombard us with emails of any phishing that you get, even if you're not 100% sure it is phishing.

---

### Keep Reporting

<input type="checkbox" id="039" /><label for="039">![039](/slides/for_everyone_part_ii/for_everyone_part_ii.039.jpeg)</label>
_039. Keep reporting phishing to us!_

That graph I showed earlier of all the phishing attempts that we detected last year, I'm pretty sure 100% of those were reported to us by you folks. We may have detected some of them first ourselves, but you still reported them to us too. For most of them, you folks even spotted them before us!

That's not to say we would never have detected them of course, but it might have been too late by the time we did if you hadn't been so good at reporting them.

So please keep reporting them to us, you are all doing a fantastic job. Whenever we give these stats to customers when they ask about our employee training and phishing mitigations, they're always astonished that we have this level of well trained staff, who can report this amount of phishing to us. So please keep it up!

### Summary of Phishing

<input type="checkbox" id="040" /><label for="040">![040](/slides/for_everyone_part_ii/for_everyone_part_ii.040.jpeg)</label>
_040. Pagey's Summary of Phishing._

So that's all I'm going to say about phishing. Here's a quick summary of what we talked about:

Always check the "from" addresses in emails, and beware of forcing or limiting language.

Verify people on another channel if you're not sure it's really them. If someone contacts you via email and you're not sure it's them, reach out on Slack and say "Hey, did you send this?", or call them on the phone and ask.

If someone gives you their phone number via email, don't just call/text that number. Look it up in another system to confirm it's really their number, or ping them on Slack first, etc. Don't let someone else dictate where you contact them.

That goes for your personal life too. If your bank sends you a letter saying you owe them money and give you a number to call, don't call the number on the letter. Find out the number for your bank from another source first. Same for letters from the IRS and so on. It's really easy to send a fake letter with a scammers phone number on instead.

And send emails to the security team if you're even a little suspicious and we'll be more than happy to take a look at any potential phishing emails you have.
